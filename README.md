# E-commerce Site

This repository contains the source code for a responsive e-commerce website. The website displays product cards fetched from an API and allows users to filter products by category.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that structures the webpage and includes links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

2. `style.css`: This file contains all the CSS styles used to design and layout the webpage. It includes media queries to make the site responsive on different screen sizes.

3. `script.js`: This JavaScript file contains the logic for fetching product data from an API, creating product cards dynamically, and filtering products based on the selected category.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Product Cards:** The product cards are created dynamically in JavaScript based on the data fetched from the API. Each card displays the product image, title, vendor, price, and a button to add the product to the cart.

- **Product Filtering:** Users can filter products by category. When a category button is clicked, only the products belonging to that category are displayed.

- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and provides a good user experience on devices of all sizes. The layout of the product cards changes depending on the screen size.

## How to Run

To run the website locally, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Future Improvements

- Add functionality to the "Add to Cart" button.
- Display a message when no products match the selected category.
- Improve error handling for the API fetch operation.
